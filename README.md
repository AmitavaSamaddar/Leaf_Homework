# Leaf_Homework

This homework is done with the earthquake data from USGS site. Dataset used is 'All Earthquakes for past day'.
Three tile layers used - satellite, greyscale and outdoor.  Control added to select the tile.
Markers added as circles at the location where earthquake registered.  Radius of the circle is proportionate to the magnitude of the quake.  Color of the circle is determined by the magnitude of the quake, darker color for higher magnitude.  Legend added to denote the color.  Control added to select/de-select the quake marker layer.
